# Grocery_Tracking_Program.cpp

# Code Project Summary:
The project involves creating a program called ItemTracker for the Corner Grocer. It helps them keep track of how often different items are bought throughout the day. With this, they can organize their shelves better and improve their inventory management.

# What I Did Well:
- Developed a user-friendly menu system for easy navigation.
- Implemented error handling to deal with mistakes in user input.
- Organized the code neatly using classes, making it easier to understand and maintain.

# Areas for Improvement:
- Could add more checks to make sure the program handles all kinds of user input gracefully.
- Enhance error handling for file operations to make the program more robust.
- Improve the appearance of the histogram for better readability.

# Challenges:
- Figuring out how to handle different types of user input and errors was tough but rewarding.
- Making sure the code was well-documented and easy to follow required some effort, but it paid off in the end.

# Support Network:
- Used online resources like documentation and forums to find solutions to problems.
- Collaborated with peers to get feedback and advice on improving the code.

# Transferable Skills:
- Learned valuable skills in programming, file handling, and error handling that can be applied to other projects.
- Practiced good coding habits like commenting and organizing code, which will help in future projects.

# Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability:
- Designed the program to be modular and easy to update, making it maintainable in the long run.
- Used clear variable and function names, along with comments, to make the code easy to read and understand.
Followed coding standards to ensure consistency and adaptability across different environments.
